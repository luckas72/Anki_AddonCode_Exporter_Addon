A mini application for those people who are lazy to get their Anki's addon code manually. 


***
## Problem

If you have ever experienced an error in Anki and the only solution is reinstallation, then all your beloved add-ons would most likely disappear. It is painful to go through the add-on page to get those add-on codes. Even worse when you have to rely on your memory which add-ons you used previously.

## Solution
An application that would extract all your add-on's code (numbers), so you could have them added once you have Anki reinstalled. 

***

## Objective 
Save lazy people's time.

## Screenshoot
